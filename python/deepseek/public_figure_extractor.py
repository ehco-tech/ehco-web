        CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. ONLY provide a Korean name (name_kr) if the person or group is actually Korean. For non-Korean public figures, name_kr MUST be an empty string.
        2. For individual public figures who are not Korean, leave name_kr as an empty string.
        3. For group members, ALWAYS include their official name as "name" and their birth name as "real_name" if different.
        4. Make sure the data returned is specifically about "{target_name}" and not a different public figure or group.
        5. For any field where information is uncertain or unknown, provide an empty string ("") or empty array ([]) as appropriate.
        6. For lastUpdated, use the current date in Korea (UTC+9) in format "YYYY-MM-DD".
        7. For URLs, provide complete URLs (including https://) or empty strings.
        8. Be extremely careful to only include Korean names (name_kr) for Korean public figures, never for non-Korean public figures.

            Generate a concise summary of the following article that focuses specifically on {public_figure_name}.
            Also identify any specific dates mentioned in the context of {public_figure_name}'s activities and what events are happening on those dates.

            Article Title: {title}
            Article Content: {description}
            Article Publication Date: {article_date}

            Instructions:
            1. Focus only on information related to {public_figure_name}
            2. Include key events, achievements, announcements, or news involving {public_figure_name}
            3. If the article only mentions {public_figure_name} briefly, provide a short summary of that mention
            4. Keep the summary between 2-4 sentences
            5. If {public_figure_name} is barely mentioned or only in passing without significant context, state that briefly
            6. Do not include information about other public figures unless it directly relates to {public_figure_name}
            7. IMPORTANT: Include any specific dates in the summary naturally, and also extract them separately along with the event for each date
            - Extract ALL dates mentioned in relation to {public_figure_name}
            - Format individual dates as YYYY-MM-DD when full date is given
            - Format individual dates as YYYY-MM when only month and year are given
            - Format individual dates as YYYY when only the year is given
            - Handle date ranges by including both start and end dates
            - For each date, create a detailed event description that includes:
            * The primary action or event that occurred (1 sentence)
            * The significance or impact of this event in context of {public_figure_name}'s career/story (1 sentence)
            * Any relevant reactions, consequences, or follow-up developments mentioned in the article (1 sentence)
            - If multiple separate dates are mentioned, include all of them with their respective events
            - If no specific date is mentioned, return an empty array
