                <h3 class="article-section-title">The Deal That Changed Everything</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Kim Ga-eul was born on September 24, 2002, in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon, South Korea. Her parents named her "Gaeul"—meaning autumn in Korean—to reflect the season of her birth. From an early age, she developed an intense passion for dancing, participating in her school's dance club and choreographing her own performances for graduation ceremonies at Bupyeongseo Girls' Middle School. During these formative years, she practiced until dawn while maintaining her studies, eventually serving as class president.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Her journey to becoming an idol, however, was not straightforward. When she first attracted the attention of entertainment industry scouts at local dance competitions, her parents opposed the idea of their daughter pursuing an idol career. But they made a deal: if she were scouted again at a future competition, they would support her dreams. This bargain would prove pivotal. In April 2017, during her third year of middle school, Gaeul competed in the preliminary round of the Incheon Youth Dance Competition. Unknown to her, scouts from multiple agencies were watching. Both JYP Entertainment and Starship Entertainment approached her after the event.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">2</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Remembering her deal with her parents, Gaeul "coolly accepted" Starship's offer. The choice would determine the course of her career—leading her not to JYP's roster but to a company preparing to debut its next flagship girl group. She entered Starship's trainee system and became an undisclosed trainee, eventually rising to become the leader among the company's female trainees.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref">3</a>

            <article class="article-section">
                <h3 class="article-section-title">The Hidden Years: 4.5 Years in the Making</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Gaeul's training period at Starship Entertainment—approximately four and a half years—was the longest among the members who would eventually form <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/ive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVE</a>. During this time, she trained alongside <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/anyujin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Yujin</a> and <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/jangwonyoung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jang Wonyoung</a> before their participation in Mnet's Produce 48 in 2018. When her fellow trainees departed for the competition—ultimately debuting with project group <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/izone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IZ*ONE</a>—Gaeul remained at the company as one of its "hidden trainees," her existence unknown to the public.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref">4</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/anyujin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yujin</a> later recalled her early impressions of her future groupmate: "I remember her as a trainee wearing braces, choppy bangs, and a black T-shirt." The company's vice president, Seo Hyun Joo, praised Gaeul's work ethic in a 2023 interview with JoongAng Ilbo, stating that Gaeul "has been working hard ever since she was a trainee."<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref">5</a>

            <article class="article-section">
                <h3 class="article-section-title">Debut and the Birth of "Gaeul Sunbae"</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    On November 4, 2021, Gaeul was revealed as the second member of Starship's new girl group IVE, following <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/anyujin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yujin</a>'s announcement the previous day. The group debuted on December 1, 2021, with the single album "Eleven." From her first stage appearance, Gaeul's unique presence caught attention. Her chic demeanor and commanding aura earned her the viral nickname "Gaeul Sunbae"—a term typically reserved for senior figures—despite being a newly debuted idol.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref">6</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    In a December 2022 interview, Gaeul reflected on the nickname: "I love the fact that there's a word that particularly describes me. These days, some actual sunbaes in the K-pop industry call me 'Gaeul Sunbae.'" The same interview marked another turning point—her signature bobbed hair, cut short for the first time for "Love Dive" promotions. "I think short hair goes well with my chic and charismatic image," she explained. "Many have said that I looked handsome with my hair short as well, and I like hearing that."<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref">7</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Her moment of mainstream viral recognition came with "After Like" (August 2022). Her "killing part"—"You know what my strength is? It's that I'm honest"—became a popular meme across Korean online communities. During university festival performances throughout 2022, she cleverly modified the line, substituting university names for "honest," creating personalized moments for each campus audience.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref">8</a>

            <article class="article-section">
                <h3 class="article-section-title">The Songwriter Emerges</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Gaeul's creative contributions extend beyond performance. Her first official songwriting credit came in April 2022 with "Royal," a B-side track on <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/ive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVE</a>'s second single album "Love Dive," where she penned the rap lyrics. According to The Korea Herald's album review, she continued this trajectory alongside fellow member <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/rei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rei</a>, contributing rap-making for four tracks on IVE's debut studio album "I've IVE" (April 2023): "Kitsch," "Hypnosis," "Not Your Girl," and "Next Page."<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref">9</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    "Kitsch," released as a pre-release single in March 2023, marked a significant milestone. Featuring lyrics co-written by Gaeul, <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/rei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rei</a>, Lee Seu-ran, and producer Hwang Hyun, it became <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/ive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVE</a>'s first chart-topping single with direct lyrical input from the members—debuting at number one on the Circle Digital Chart and achieving <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/ive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVE</a>'s second Perfect All-Kill. The Korea Herald noted that the track "contains the message that the members don't want people judging them for who they are, and that they themselves are the new trend."<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref">10</a>

                <h3 class="article-section-title">From Dancer to Choreographer</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    In 2025, Gaeul's artistry expanded into choreography. For IVE's third fan concert "IVE SCOUT" (April 2025), she collaborated with renowned choreographer Simeez to develop the dance routine for "TKO," a track from their third EP "IVE EMPATHY." A behind-the-scenes vlog released on <a href="https://www.ehco.ai/ive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVE</a>'s official YouTube channel showed Gaeul pitching a boxing ring concept, designing formations with fellow member Rei, and independently choreographing the second verse. She described her goal: matching the song's bold, dynamic energy with powerful movements.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref">11</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Her choreographic work continued with "♥beats," a B-side from the group's fourth EP "IVE SECRET" (November 2025). "I truly believe we paid attention to every single detail," Gaeul shared in a vlog documenting the creation process. "I thought about the members while creating choreography filled with love. I wanted it to suit everyone, for each person to stand out, and for it to be cute and refreshing."

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    IVE's second world tour, "SHOW WHAT I AM," launched at KSPO DOME in Seoul from October 31 to November 2, 2025. A major highlight was the premiere of unreleased solo songs from each member—their first-ever solo stages. Gaeul presented "Odd," a dreamy, introspective track for which she participated in writing the lyrics. The Korea Herald described her performance as one that "shifted the stage's tone," noting her "smooth and deep vocals."<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref">13</a>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    "Since it was my first solo, I wanted to show a dreamy and mysterious charm," Gaeul explained during the concert's talk segment. "I gave a lot of input on the costumes and props. I told the members it was a concept like a saint, and I was happy that the fans recognized it. I participated in writing the lyrics for the first time, so it's a very meaningful song." The tour follows their first world tour "SHOW WHAT I HAVE," which attracted 420,000 fans across 19 countries.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref">14</a>

                    Beyond group promotions, Gaeul has established herself in fashion and entertainment. She was selected as the model for Lenina's 2022 F/W collection (November 2022) and appeared in New Balance's backpack collection campaign (December 2022). Her magazine credits include covers for L'Officiel Singapore ("Beyond the Horizon" issue, April 2023), Chicteen (December 2022), and L'Officiel Korea's YK Edition (Spring/Summer 2024), along with features in Elle Korea (September 2022), W Korea showcasing Dolce & Gabbana (May 2023), and Esquire Korea (April 2025).<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref">15</a>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Her fashion event appearances span luxury brands: Chanel's Parfumeur Masterclass (January 2023), Dolce & Gabbana's Seoul flagship launch for the DG Logo Bag (May 2023), and the 2026 Spring/Summer Seoul Fashion Week opening show by Andersson Bell at Deoksu Palace (September 2025)—her first public fashion show attendance. On television, she appeared as a guest on MBC's King of Masked Singer (episodes 400-401, 2023) and Mnet's I Can See Your Voice 10 (episode 125, 2023), and served as special MC on MBC's Show!

                    On May 27, 2025, Gaeul achieved what she described as a "bucket list dream"—throwing the ceremonial first pitch for the LG Twins at Jamsil Baseball Stadium. "I'm nervous, but also very excited," she shared beforehand. "I'll do my best to bring positive energy to the team." Her rising profile earned her a nomination for "Fan Vote Artist - Female" at the 2025 Korea Grand Music Awards.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref">17</a>
