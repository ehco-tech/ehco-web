        2. For individual public figures who are not Korean, leave name_kr as an empty string.
        3. For group members, ALWAYS include their official name as "name" and their birth name as "real_name" if different.
        4. Make sure the data returned is specifically about "{name}" and not a different public figure or group.
        5. For any field where information is uncertain or unknown, provide an empty string ("") or empty array ([]) as appropriate.
        6. For lastUpdated, use the current date in Korea (UTC+9) in format "YYYY-MM-DD".
        7. For URLs, provide complete URLs (including https://) or empty strings.
        8. Be extremely careful to only include Korean names (name_kr) for Korean public figures, never for non-Korean public figures.
